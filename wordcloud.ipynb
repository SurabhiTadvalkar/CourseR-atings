No homework, gave out extra credit which was to go to a museum and answer the questions, she gives out pop quizzes which are short answer(about 3-4 questions), midterm was short answer questions and a page front and back of multiple choice (midterm is easy only if you study) gotta rememeber the images she shows, final is online and she posts questions all you gotta do is answer each question using key terms and at least a page each. legit all her quizzes and tests are all on the lecture so just show up to class. sounds like a lot but its really not. good luck.
